          1.	Acceptance
      </p><p>

User’s use of the Site and, if applicable, User’s use of Giving Pilot’s fundraising platform (the “Service”) is at all times subject to this Agreement.

For purposes of this Agreement, accessing the Site only to review this Agreement or Giving Pilot’s privacy policy, a link to which is available on the homepage of the Site (the “Privacy Policy”) is not deemed to be use of the Site.

      <p>
          19.	Miscellaneous
      </p><p>

This Agreement (a) inures to the benefit of, and is binding upon, User and Giving Pilot and each of User’s and Giving Pilot’s successors and assignees, except that User may not assign any of User’s rights or obligations under this Agreement without first obtaining the written consent of Giving Pilot, and (b) constitutes the entire agreement between User and Giving Pilot with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and supersedes all prior oral and written proposals, representations, understandings and agreements. Any attempt by User to assign to a third party any right or remedy hereunder without Giving Pilot’s prior written consent will be null and void, and of no effect. Giving Pilot may, in its sole discretion, assign, delegate, or otherwise transfer this Agreement (including, but not limited to, all of its obligations, rights and remedies) to a third party. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between any provision of this Agreement and any provision contained on the Site (other than the Privacy Policy), the former will control. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between any provision of this Agreement and any provision contained in the Privacy Policy, the latter will control.

User represents and warrants to Giving Pilot that User (1) has carefully read this Agreement, (2) is entering into this Agreement on behalf of User and, if applicable, a third party, and (3) has sufficient capacity to enter into this Agreement and bind User and, if applicable, such third party.
